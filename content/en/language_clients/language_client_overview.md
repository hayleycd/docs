Sigstore uses [cosign](../../cosign/signing/overview) to sign and verify packages by default, but you can opt to use a language specific client instead.

Sigstore has clients for the following language ecosystems:

- [Go](../go/overview)
- [Java](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-java#sigstore-java)
- [JavaScript](../javascript/overview)
- [Python](../python/overview)
- [Rust](../rust/overview)
- [Ruby](../ruby/overview)

Language client documentation is hosted in the individual project repositories. Project summaries are currently being added to the main Sigstore documentation.
