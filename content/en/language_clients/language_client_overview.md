Sigstore uses [cosign](../../cosign/signing/overview) to sign and verify packages by default, but you can opt to use a language specific client instead.

Sigstore has clients for the following language ecosystems:

- [Python](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python#sigstore-python)
- [Rust](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-rs#features)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-ruby#sigstore)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-js#sigstore-js---)
- [Java](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-java#sigstore-java)
- [Go](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go#sigstore-go)

Currently, language client documentation is hosted in the individual project repositories. This documentation is being migrated to the general sigstore docs.
